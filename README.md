Odin Project - Calculator

With the functionality of basic calculator. It has a percentage, delete and clear functions. This project should work with most browsers. Works with mouse and keyboard as well.

Demonstrated DOM manipulation skills and CSS Flexbox. I was able to apply what I've learned so far. Created functions that works with click and keydown events. Also used multiple event listeners to change the background color when pressed or clicked.
